# Important notes

---------------

### Data import on docker compose
- When your first go on the site, a python script runs to add all the data in the base
- Dockers's behaviour regarding django modules causes an issue when our script runs twice. We found a solution with fixtures, but we didn't have enought time to implement them (we ran into an encoding issue). Because of this, we added a try/except within all functions importing data. This is a temporary fix and prevent our fields from being duplicated. We know this isn't optimal and plan to improve it later.

### Triggers
- Regarding triggers, you'll notice that none are present in our code. We'll explain why : Django already includes a number of pre-built triggers linked to models. Meaning that before any field is about to be added to the database, a trigger checks if the data is valid : does is have the same type as described in the model, and so on.
- You may notice that some fields in our models have an "onCascade=delete" attribute. This means that whenever a primary key is currently used as a foreign key in another table, it can't be deleted to prevent errors. Inversely, it allows the deletion of a field if it contains a foreign key, because it won't affect the rest of the data.
